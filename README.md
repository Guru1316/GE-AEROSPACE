# Compute Product - Vue.js Project

This project is a simple Vue.js application I built to practice and understand the basics of Vue.  
It displays two numbers, and when the **Compute** button is clicked, it calculates and shows their product.  
The button then disappears, and only the result is shown.

I also added a heading and an image to make the UI more clear and engaging.  

ðŸ‘‰ This is my **first Vue.js project**, created as a starting point to learn Vue and build more projects in the future.
